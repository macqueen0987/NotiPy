        <h2>Article 1 (Purpose)</h2>
        <p>This policy explains how the service collects, uses and protects personal data. The company (the Discord bot)
            complies with relevant laws and securely handles user information.</p>
        <h2>Article 2 (Principles of Personal Data Handling)</h2>
        <p>Only the minimum personal data is collected, used solely for the stated purpose, and never shared with third
            parties without consent.</p>
        <h2>Article 3 (Publication)</h2>
        <p>This policy is always available via Discord commands or the linked web page.</p>
        <h2>Article 4 (Changes)</h2>
        <p>We announce changes at least 7 days in advance, and major changes at least 30 days in advance.</p>
        <h2>Article 5 (Data Collected and Methods)</h2>

        </ul>
        <h2>Article 7 (Retention Period)</h2>
        <p>Personal data is destroyed once the purpose is achieved and is not kept long term. Notion tokens are deleted
            immediately when unlinked or the bot is removed from the server.</p>
        <h2>Article 8 (Statutory Retention)</h2>
        <p>We do not collect consumer or payment records, so statutory retention periods are not applicable.</p>
        <h2>Article 9 (Destruction of Personal Data)</h2>
        <p>Personal data that has served its purpose or exceeded its retention period is promptly destroyed using
            irreversible methods.</p>
        <h2>Article 9‑2 (Overseas Transfer)</h2>
        <p>We use overseas APIs such as Discord, GitHub and Notion. Information is sent to those platforms only for
            authentication and is not stored separately by the company.</p>
        <h2>Article 10 (Procedure for Deletion)</h2>
        <p>All personal data is kept electronically and deleted immediately when no longer needed.</p>
        <h2>Article 11 (Method of Deletion)</h2>
        <p>Electronic files are securely destroyed using technical measures that prevent recovery.</p>
        <h2>Article 12 (Cookies)</h2>
        <p>Cookies may be used to provide customized service. Users can refuse them through browser settings.</p>
        <ul>

        <h2>Article 15 (Notion Integration Permissions)</h2>
        <p>Users connect with a self‑created Notion integration token that has access only to databases they
            designate.<br/>
            <strong>For security, grant only page read access. Do not grant permissions to edit, delete or share
                pages.</strong> The company is not liable for issues caused by incorrect permission settings.</p>
        <h2>Article 16 (Inquiries)</h2>
        <p>For questions about this policy, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/HzAnBSCN7t">official support server</a>
