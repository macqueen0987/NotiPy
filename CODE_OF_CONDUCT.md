# Code of Conduct

This project is open source and is managed through GitHub, a Discord server (including the bot), and a Notion workspace. Please abide by the following code of conduct to ensure a safe and enjoyable collaboration for everyone.

## Our Pledge

Everyone participating in this project is entitled to respect regardless of age, gender, race, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, or level of experience.  
Contributors, maintainers, users, and document editors pledge to:

- Communicate with inclusive language and attitudes.  
- Listen to and respect diverse perspectives.  
- Welcome constructive feedback and respond positively to suggestions for improvement.  
- Prioritize the benefit of the community as a whole.  
- Always show empathy and consideration toward one another.

## Our Standards

### GitHub
- Be courteous when opening issues or pull requests; do not disparage others’ work.  
- In code reviews, explain not only *what* is wrong but also *how* to improve it.  
- Include clear, friendly explanations in commit messages and documentation to enhance readability.

### Discord Server
- Keep conversations on-topic in official channels (e.g., `#general`, `#support`, `#dev-chat`).  
- Use bot commands correctly; avoid spam or repetitive invocations.  
- Post questions, discussions, and announcements in designated channels; refrain from unnecessary pings in DMs.  
- Do not attack other users or use excessive language or derogatory expressions.

### Notion Workspace
- When creating or editing pages, provide clear titles and descriptions so others can easily understand the content.  
- Before editing, use the page’s “Discussion” block or comments to discuss changes in advance.  
- Record important information consistently (e.g., in the “Project Status” database or “Roadmap” page).  
- Avoid creating duplicate pages; if content overlaps, update the existing page instead.  
- Use `@mentions` appropriately to notify relevant stakeholders; avoid excessive mentions.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- All forms of abuse, including insults, hate speech, sexual harassment, bullying, etc.  
- Unauthorized sharing of personal information (real names, email addresses, contact details, etc.).  
- Trolling or intentionally provoking disputes.  
- Repeated spam messages or misuse of bots.  
- Deleting Notion content without permission or hiding edit history.  
- Other unethical or unprofessional behavior.

## Enforcement

Reports can be made via a GitHub issue, an `@ProjectAdmin` mention (DM) on Discord, or a comment/mention in Notion.  
When reporting, please include:

- A description of the violation (screenshots or links are helpful).  
- The time and location (channel, issue number, Notion page, etc.).

The team will investigate and take action within **3 business days** of receiving a report and may request additional information if needed.  
Depending on the severity of the violation, actions may include warnings, temporary channel restrictions, or revocation of contribution privileges.
