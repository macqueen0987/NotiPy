## üöß This project is currently under development!

Notipy is a Python-based Discord bot that monitors a Notion database and sends notifications to a Discord channel when specific conditions are met.
It can be used as a real-time alert tool in various collaboration scenarios, such as scheduling, task management, and issue tracking.
It is structured using a FastAPI-based backend server and SQLAlchemy ORM, supporting seamless integration with the Notion API and Discord interaction system.
**Note: As this project is under active development, some services may be unstable or temporarily unavailable without prior notice.**
<a id="key-features"></a>

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Notion

* Users must individually create a Notion Integration for their own workspace and provide its token directly.
* This token only grants access to events within the user's workspace and is never transmitted outside the server or shared.

#### üìå Webhook Reception and Processing

* Receives events such as page creation, updates, and deletion via webhook and relays this information to the Discord channel.
* Supports creating threads in forum channels or updating existing messages.
<a id="database-integration"></a>
* Stores linkage data between Notion pages and Discord threads in the database to maintain persistent alert tracking.

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Integration

* Synchronizes page properties from the registered Notion databases to use as filter conditions or message content.
* Detects changes in page content and periodically updates the corresponding Discord notification.
* Supports multiple database connections per server, with each server managed independently.

#### üîé Why must users provide their own Notion token?

* **Access Control**: By creating the integration themselves, users can **explicitly control which workspaces or databases the bot can access**.
* **Flexible Webhook Configuration**: Users can **manually configure desired events** (e.g., page creation/updates) within Notion.
* **Security and Data Isolation**: Since each token is tied to a user's workspace only, it ensures isolated and secure integration.

üìñ **Notion Token Setup Guide:**
üëâ [How to create a Notion Integration and get the token](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration)

<a id="github-profile-analysis-and-summary"></a>
### üß† GitHub Profile Analysis and Summary

* Collects GitHub profile data based on user-provided URLs and summarizes key information using LLM.
* Summaries can be accessed by other users on Discord if permission is granted.

<a id="project-creation-and-management"></a>
### üõ†Ô∏è Project Creation and Management

* Users can create new projects via Discord commands or interaction.
* Projects are uniquely identified by server ID and user ID, allowing each user to manage their own list.
* Each project has metadata like title, description, and category, and can be easily edited through the Discord UI.

<a id="internal-request-validation-and-security"></a>
### üîí Internal Request Validation and Security

All internal API requests are validated via the `X-Internal-Request` header in FastAPI.
This header is automatically set to `false` by Nginx for external requests, while only internal Docker network requests may bypass or set it to `true`.

* External requests ‚Üí `X-Internal-Request: false` (forced by Nginx)
* Internal Docker communication ‚Üí Direct access or set to `true`

This prevents external actors from spoofing internal API calls.

<a id="getting-started-as-a-user"></a>
## üß≠ Getting Started as a User

You can use **Notipy without self-hosting**. Simply invite the bot to your Discord server and start using its features immediately. Here's a quick guide:

### ‚úÖ Step 1. Invite the Bot

* You can invite the bot from the [official website](https://notipy.code0987.com) or directly via this [invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=955999346321686609).
* After inviting the bot, we recommend using the `/settings set-modrole` command to ensure smooth operation.
