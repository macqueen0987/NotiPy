Personal data is destroyed once the purpose is achieved and is not kept long term. Notion tokens are deleted immediately when unlinked or the bot is removed from the server.

## Article 14 (Third‑Party Provision and Outsourcing)

## Article 15 (Notion Integration Permissions)
Users connect with a self‑created Notion integration token that has access only to databases they designate. **For security, grant only page read access. Do not grant permissions to edit, delete or share pages.** The company is not liable for issues caused by incorrect permission settings.
